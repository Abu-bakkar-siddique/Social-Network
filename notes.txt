KEEP IN MIND:
There is a global user state now, 
the login function updates the user's authentication status when
    login credentials are correct

In App Component, if the user is not authenticated, API call is made 
to the server to check if the user is valid user or not.

>>>>> Because the backend serves an an API that's why DONOT redirect or render other pages(except for in index view)
"ONLY Json response in and Json out".

WHERE I LEFT OFF:
    
    -> all functions review and testing 
    -> profilePage component

######## LESSONS ########:
    React hooks must always be called in the same order, regardless of conditions. means can't place the 
    useEffect Hook inside a conditional.

    pass the setState_X function to some component_Y if i want to change component_X based on logic on component_Y
    React encourages to use sideEffects when, doing some state change inside the component functions
    so the components are pure render functions.

    in_short:
        -> state changes are inside sideEffect hooks, anything that is not part of the rendering 
        must go inside the sideEffect(fetching, state updation etc).

        -> hooks are always called inside the function body, not inside some conditional

SOUGHT THIS OUT :
    implenting  all posts component first

    comments will be represented with a saperate state for simplicity
    as {post_id: [comments] ...}, where each comment is a JS object.
