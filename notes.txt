PROBLEM:
1. NoneType error in the backend:
    The issue is not with the type param extraction in the frontend.


## IMPORTANT OBSERVATION:
on the reload of the Allposts component, the url that hits the backend is:
GET /feed?type=all HTTP/1.1" 500
and not the API endpoint url(GET /feed?category=all&page=1) that is being called in the useEffect of
the component.

this problem does not arise in the profile/ since the url in the 
browser and the URL of the API endpoint match

POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
make the api endpoint url and the brower url same:
  => change the string 'type' to 'category' in the url 
  => add the infromation about the 'page'
  this will match the endpoint url.
