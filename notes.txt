# TODO
on commenter's profile picture click:
    pass this commenter's userId to the history.push("/profile") 
    decode this userId in the profile component to show this commenters profile 

problem:
the profile component already takes userId as props to decide whos profile is supposed 
to be fetched.
I'd have to differentiate bw IF the profile page request is of the user's own or some commenter's profile
